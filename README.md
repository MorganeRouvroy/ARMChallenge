### Usage Guide

/!\ This application requires an Internet connection to run correctly.

The application uses the centre of the map as the current reference location (e.g. when finding schools within a radius).

##### Find Nearest Health facilities

After positioning the centre of the of the map at the desired location,
clicking the `Find nearest health site` button will move to and mark the nearest
health facility on the map. The application shows the name, coordinates and the distance
of the health facility from the current location.

##### Find Health Facilities and Schools Within a Radius
In the 'find nearby' section, enter desired radius in km in the field and click the `Health site` or `School` button.
The application will show the radius on map and mark health facilities or schools within the radius.
The coordinates, radius and the number of schools will be displayed.

##### Search Location

The `Search` button allows you to search for locations in Colombia - for example, searching 'Hospital de San Jose' will go to the [corresponding hospital in Bogota](http://www.hospitaldesanjose.org.co/).

##### Coverage Analysis

For each state in Colombia, the average distance from each school to the nearest healthfacility is calculated in km.
This is displayed using the `Display Coverage` control; states in green have a lower average distance (and are thus 'better serviced' by health facilities).
Clicking a state will display the exact average distance.

### Misc
